# Report for assignment 3

## Project

Name: `python-discord/bot`

URL: https://github.com/python-discord/bot/tree/main

It is a Discord bot specifically for use with the Python Discord server which has ~400k members. It provides numerous utilities and other tools to help keep the server running like a well-oiled machine.

## Onboarding experience

It mostly ran flawlessly, with a few caveats as outlined below:
- @strengthless was on Apple Silicon M2 chip, and some docker images were not pulled successfully on the first try.
  - I had to refer to [this stack overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65456814/docker-apple-silicon-m1-preview-mysql-no-matching-manifest-for-linux-arm64-v8) and run the command `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/x86_64/v8`
- @strengthless kept getting the `PrivilegedIntentsRequired` error upon docker startup.
  - Turns out when setting up [Privileged Gateway Intents](https://www.pythondiscord.com/pages/guides/pydis-guides/contributing/bot/#privileged-intents), aside from `Server Member Intent`, you also need to enable `Message Content Intent`, which is a relatively new intent introduced by Discord.
  - We have submitted a PR in [python-discord/site](https://github.com/python-discord/site/pull/1470) for updating the relevant documentations, which has been accepted.

After setting up the environment, we ran a quick analysis on LoCs and test coverage:
```bash
# lines of code in python (~19.3k)
cloc ./bot
# branch coverage (~50%)
poetry run task test-cov && poetry run task report
```

With everything combined, we deemed the project suitable for this assignment.

## Complexity

1. What are your results for five complex functions?
    * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
        - Using [lizard](https://pypi.org/project/lizard/) (`lizard --sort nloc`), we found those five large functions:
          ```
            NLOC    CCN   token  PARAM  length  location  
          ------------------------------------------------
            141     26    652      8     175 apply_infraction@126-300@./bot/exts/moderation/infraction/_scheduler.py
            114     17    577      5     140 deactivate_infraction@393-532@./bot/exts/moderation/infraction/_scheduler.py
            108     18    485      5     130 infraction_edit@149-278@./bot/exts/moderation/infraction/management.py
            101     16    304      5     113 humanize_delta@131-243@./bot/utils/time.py
             76     20    412      3      85 on_command_error@65-149@./bot/exts/backend/error_handler.py
          ```
        - By counting manually and cross-checking, we reached the following consensus:
            - For `apply_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, we get 27 CCN.
            - For `deactivate_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, we get 17 CCN.
            - For `infraction_edit@infraction/management.py`, we get
            - For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, we get 16 CCN.
            - For `on_command_error@backend/error_handler.py`, we get 20 CCN.
    * Are the results clear?
        - Some of us got different results. Upon discussing further, it was discovered that we had different methods in counting CCNs, e.g. how we deal with switch-cases, logical operators, list comprehensions, etc. Once we had those clarified, we started getting consistent results.
        - The CCNs we counted were mostly the same as Lizard's. There is, however, one small caveat for `apply_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py` - we counted 27 CCN instead of 26.
            - Upon further investigation, it looks like line 299 was not counted by Lizard, which included a ternary operator within a string literal.
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
    - We observe a slight correlation, but no causal effects. Generally speaking, if a function is long, then it's more probable that it contains some sort of complex code. However, there is no strict correlation here, as short functions can still be complex, vice versa.
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
    - For `deactivate_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, it is a function that deactivates infraction status for users in the database and returns a log of the removed infraction.
    - For `apply_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, it is a function that applies an infraction to the user and logs the infraction. It can also notify the user of the infraction.
    - For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, it is a function that takes in a period of time (e.g. start and end timestamps) as its arguments, then convert it into a human-readable string.
    - For `on_command_error@./bot/exts/backend/error_handler.py`, it is a function that provides error messages given a generic error by deferring errors to local error handlers.
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
    - Yes, for both Lizard and our manual counting. If we don't take them into account, then the resultant CCN could drop.
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?
    - For `deactivate_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, some parts of the function were easy to read with regards to all the possible outcomes, as the function utilises if/else statements in variable assignment without documenting the use case.
    - For `apply_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, the function is quite easy to read and understand by the given documentation.  
    - For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, exceptions were not explicitly documented. Other than that, the function only produces a string as its outcome, therefore we think the documentation was mostly clear.
    - For `on_command_error@./bot/exts/backend/error_handler.py`, the documentation provides a clear and concise description of most of the functions behaviour, but seems to fail to document the `CommandInvokeError` branch behaviour almost entirely.

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:
- For `deactivate_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, we plan on extracting the 3 different try/exepct blocks into separate methods (pardon_infraction, user_is_watched, update_db).
- For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, we plan on extracting methods, as the function is composed of two main parts, parsing of overload arguments into time delta, and stringification of the delta. Arguably, the former can be delegated to a separate helper function, which should greatly reduce the cyclomatic complexity.  
- For `actions_for@./bot/exts/filtering/_filter_lists/invite.py`, we plan on extracting methods, as the function is composed of many steps that can be isolated into separate functions. One could extract functionalities like redefining invites, sorting invites, finding blocked invites and cleaning up invites into separate functions.  

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?):
- For `deactivate_infraction@infraction/_scheduler.py`, some drawbacks are decreased readablility of the code and increased function calls. 
- For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, no drawbacks are anticipated, except for the use of `typing.Any` in the type signature for the new helper function. However, since type hints are not strongly enforced in Python (they're just **hints** for humans), this should not be a huge deal.  
-  For `actions_for@./bot/exts/filtering/_filter_lists/invite.py`, no drawbacks are anticipated.

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):
- For `humanize_delta@utils/time.py`, we have [PR #4](https://github.com/dd2480-spring-2025-group-1/bot/pull/4) which reduces CCN by 37.5%.
- For `actions_for@./bot/exts/filtering/_filter_lists/invite.py`, we have [PR #22](https://github.com/dd2480-spring-2025-group-1/bot/pull/22) which reduces CCN by 35.1%.

Note: since the `on_command_error` function already has 100% test coverage as reported by `coverage.py`, we decided to do part 2 of the assignment with `actions_for` instead, which is the function with the highest CCN as reported by lizard (CCN 37) and it has 20% test coverage.

## Coverage

### Tools

We used [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.12/) as our main coverage tool, as the tool had already been integrated into the project.

The tool's usage had been well documented in `tests/README.md`, with shortcut commands implemented.

There is only one small caveat here: coverage by function or class is not natively supported by `coverage.py` in the CLI (see this [github issue](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1859) for more information). We specifically switched to a fork version of `coverage.py` for this.
- To view the branch coverage report for a specific function, you can now run `poetry run task report --functions` with the help of the fork.
- To view the missing branches, there is still no easy method. You need to add `# pragma: no cover` to ignore all other functions in the file, then export a JSON report via `poetry run coverage json ./path/to/somefile.py`.

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements: [link](https://github.com/dd2480-spring-2025-group-1/bot/pull/10)

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?
- We provide a general framework for manually appending the instrumentations:
    - For boolean related constructs (e.g., `if`, `elif`, `x if y else z`, `while`, etc.), wrap the boolean with `cov_if(bool, idx, idx+1)`.
    - For loop related constructs (e.g., `for`, `x for y in z`, etc.), wrap the iterable with `cov_for(list, idx, idx+1)`.
    - We currently do not support switch cases, generators, or other constructs that were not explicitly mentioned above.
    - You can then run `poetry run task test -rP -n 1 ./path/to/somefile.py` to run the test cases and view its coverage report.
- The reporting tool should be accurate (assuming that all required constructs are supported), though it is highly prone to human errors, as it requires manual analysis on the branches for setting up the coverage tool.

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?
- We report the overall coverage of a function, and the IDs of the branches that were not covered.
- The level of "detailness" depends on the person implementing the coverage - whether they decide to include coverage for boolean operators (i.e., `and`, `or`), exceptions, or list comprehensions etc.

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?
- As mentioned above, there are some constructs that we currently do not support.
- It requires manual analysis on the branching of the code.
- Once set up, the readability of the code is greatly affected, as a lot of `cov_if` and `cov_for` function calls are injected into the original code, which causes some degree of "obfuscation".

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?
- The reported number of total branches are consistent.
- However, the numbers of missing branches (which you can obtain using `poetry run coverage json ./bot/utils/time.py`) are different.
    - Upon further investigation, we realized that it's because our tool was only checking against `test_time.py` for branch coverage on `time.py`. On the contrary, `coverage.py` records all LoC transitions when running **all** test files, then compares them against a list of possible branch transitions (statically analysed), which yields the final branch coverage report ([ref](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.12/branch.html#how-it-works)).
    - For example, let's assume `humanize_delta@time.py` is used in the function `get_slowmode@slowmode.py`, and `get_slowmode` is tested in `test_slowmode.py`. When the test suite for `test_slowmode.py` runs, some branches within `humanize_delta@time.py` will also be executed, and thereby increasing the branch coverage on `time.py`, despite it not being tested directly.
    - This explains why `coverage.py` reports higher coverage than our tool, though we would argue that no tool is in the wrong here - it's just a matter of perspective, whether you prefer to infer coverage from only the "direct" test cases, or also the "indirect" ones.
        - In fact, we might even suggest that our tool is better in this case, as the indirect ones are much harder to debug if there happens to be a regression, because it's now some random test `test_slowmode.py` failing, instead of the actual culprit `humanize_delta@time.py`, which would've been reported if there were 100% "direct coverage".

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage:
- For `utils/helpers.py`, the functions are fairly straightforward. The requirements were already well documented in the one-line docstrings. The only caveat here is the `has_lines` function, which ignores one `\n` character from the end of the string when counting the number of lines.

Report of old coverage:
```
Name                          Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover   Missing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bot/utils/helpers.py             23      8      4      1    67%   19, 25-28, 38-43
```

Report of new coverage:
```
Name                          Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover   Missing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bot/utils/helpers.py             23      0      4      0   100%
```

Test cases added:
- For `utils/helpers.py`, [PR #3260](https://github.com/python-discord/bot/pull/3260) had been created by @strengthless, approved and merged into the upstream, which included 7 new test cases.
